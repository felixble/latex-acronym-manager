# latex-acronym-manager
Simple java command line tool to create and update the list of abbreviations for a latex document.

When writing a paper or thesis it is common to enclose a list of abbreviations. With latex this can be done by writing
a seperate tex-file in which the abbreviations are defined. All abbreviation must be declared in a specific style and must be
ordered alphabetically.

With this tool you can simply add new abbreviations and you don't have to worry about alphabetical order or which one is the longest one for correct spacing.

Usage:
You can start the application from the command line just as a usual java application. Optionally you can pass the path to the abbreviation tex-file as a program parameter.
